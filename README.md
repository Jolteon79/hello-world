# hello-world

well I had to change the readme

Hi, I'm Ethan W AKA Jolteon79 here on github. Using this for the Processing intro unit @ school.
I could be an accomplished Pokemon Trainer, a dude in a green tunic with a bunch of magic stuff or a really neat wolf. Depends on the Pokemon or Zelda game i'm on.
